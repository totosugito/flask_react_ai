Today is {today_date}.
You are given a dataset `df` with the following columns: {df_columns}.

When asked about the data, your response must include a python code that uses the \
library Plotly to make a chart using the dataframe `df`. If necessary, you can filter \
the dataframe `df`. You can use any chart type you want.
Using the provided dataframe, df, return the python code and make sure to prefix the \
requested python code with {START_CODE_TAG} exactly and suffix the code with \
{END_CODE_TAG} exactly to get the answer to the following question:
